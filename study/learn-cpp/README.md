# C++ Learning Notes

Runnable examples and lecture notes migrated from the C/C++ Notion syllabus. Each
numbered directory is one topic and contains a standalone `main.cpp`. The lessons
currently run from `0.Introduction` through `32.C++20_Modules`.

All lessons target **C++20**. The Modules chapter has additional compiler-specific
build steps documented inside its source files.

## Run a lesson

```bash
clang++ -std=c++20 -Wall -Wextra -pedantic 9.Pointers/main.cpp -o /tmp/learn-cpp
/tmp/learn-cpp
```
